        The website is for beginners to learn to make up. I have some sort of header and have five pages, and each has meaningful purpose and each of them has favicon. <br> There are some links to other pages, if you want to learn more, you can click the images and it will show you another. <br> So, it has navigation links. My web page can fit the size of a computer and a mobile phone. And I have separate css for each html. <br> I have different files for css, html and js. I didn’t use any libraries or frameworks. My site validates without any warnings and errors using W3C’s HTML validator and CSS validator. <br> The names of my files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters. My site has been served out of 8443.

        As a girl, I think the content of this makeup site is filtered and presented to beginners like me. The first page simply states the purpose of the site, and the scrolling animation tells me what's inside the site. The following table is to collect some information about people who are interested in makeup. 
        I think it is probably to gather us together with social software, and then we can learn makeup from each other. The 2nd page simply introduced the candidate of what color of skin what kind of pink ground color number, I feel to me such make up beginner is very useful, because the first step of makeup is 
        powdery bottom, the powdery bottom fluid that you should choose to suit oneself color of skin just can have a good base makeup. The designer recommended Armani’s foundation alone, and I went to learn about it. Armani's foundation has a texture and color number suitable for almost everyone, which saves a lot
        of trouble for beginners and requires less effort to learn about other brands. The third page introduces lipsticks, some are not very expensive, and some are big brands. If you see your favorite lipstick can immediately click on the picture to the official website to buy. On the introduction of eye shadow, 
        the designer specially recommended color pop, I think this is very suitable for beginners, because color pop variety is more and cheap, cost-effective, very suitable for beginners, so even if you buy the wrong will not be too distressed. Finally, about the introduction of makeup tools, the designer briefly 
        introduced some commonly used makeup tools, for beginners only need to use these tools, so will not spend too much money to buy some unnecessary things. This website is not very informative, but it is good enough for beginners. The page can be zoomed in or out, and it's comfortable to look at on your phone
